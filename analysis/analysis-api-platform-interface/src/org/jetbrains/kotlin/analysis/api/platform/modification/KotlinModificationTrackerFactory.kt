/**
 * [KotlinModificationTrackerFactory] creates modification trackers for select modification events.
 *
 * In K2 mode, the modification trackers created by this factory must be incremented on specific [KotlinModificationEvent]s. In that sense,
 * they can be viewed as a facade for modification events, for the use case when there are many, possibly short-lived objects that need to
 * be notified of a change. In such cases, listener and subscriber management has too much overhead, making modification trackers the
 * preferred solution.
 *
 * ### Implementation Notes
 *
 * [KotlinModificationTrackerByEventFactoryBase] can be inherited from to implement this platform component based on published modification
 * events.
